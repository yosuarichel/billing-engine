# Project README

> **Project**: Loan Billing Engine (Go Microservice with Kitex RPC + HTTP)

## Overview

This project is a **loan billing engine** implemented as a Go-based microservice. Its primary job is to:

* Generate a loan schedule for a given loan (when and how much to pay).
* Provide the outstanding amount for a given loan.
* Determine whether the customer is **delinquent** (missed payments).

We offer loans of **Rp 5,000,000** over **50 weeks** with a flat annual interest rate of **10%**. The billing engine provides a repayment schedule (weekly installments, e.g., Rp 110,000 per week).

The system tracks repayments, calculates outstanding balances, and determines delinquency (customers missing 2 continuous weekly repayments are marked as delinquent). Customers must also cover missed payments (e.g., if 2 weeks are missed, they must pay 2 installments to catch up).

---

## Core Features

* **Repayment Schedule**: Generate 50-week repayment schedule with flat interest.
* **Outstanding Balance Tracking**: Keep track of remaining balance as payments are made.
* **Delinquency Tracking**: Borrowers who miss 2 consecutive repayments are flagged delinquent.
* **RPC API** (via Kitex) and **HTTP API** (with Postman collection included).
* **Database Persistence** with PostgreSQL.
* **Message Queue Integration** with NSQ.

---

## Supported Methods

* **GetOutstanding**: Returns the current outstanding loan amount (0 if loan is fully paid).
* **IsDelinquent**: Returns delinquency status (true if borrower missed more than 2 consecutive repayments).
* **MakePayment**: Records repayment of a given amount.

---

## Requirements

* **Go >= 1.24.7**
* **Go Modules** enabled
* **thriftgo** (for Thrift IDL):

  ```bash
  go install github.com/cloudwego/thriftgo@latest
  ```
* **kitex** CLI:

  ```bash
  go install github.com/cloudwego/kitex/tool/cmd/kitex@latest
  ```
* **kitexcall** CLI:

  ```bash
  go install github.com/kitex-contrib/kitexcall@latest
  ```
* **Docker** or **Podman**
* **PostgreSQL**
* **NSQ** (optional)

---

## Running the Service

### 1. Start server and all dependencies

```bash
make all
```

### 2. Generate Kitex Code (if IDL changed)

```bash
make kitexgen
```

### 3. Run Migrations
Currently we do it manually by executing the sql directly in pgsql

## RPC Testing with **kitexcall**

1. GetOutstanding:

```bash
kitexcall --idl-path ./conf/.idl/billing_engine/billing_engine_service.thrift --method BillingEngineService/GetOutstanding --endpoint 127.0.0.1:60001 -d '{"loan_id":"38999051395417340"}'  
```

2. IsDelinquent:

```bash
kitexcall --idl-path ./conf/.idl/billing_engine/billing_engine_service.thrift --method BillingEngineService/IsDelinquent --endpoint 127.0.0.1:60001 -d '{"loan_id":"38951915102405456"}'  
```

3. MakePayment:

```bash
kitexcall --idl-path ./conf/.idl/billing_engine/billing_engine_service.thrift --method BillingEngineService/MakePayment --endpoint 127.0.0.1:60001 -d '{"loan_id":"38999051395417340", "amount":100000}'
```

4. CreateLoan:

```bash
kitexcall --idl-path ./conf/.idl/billing_engine/billing_engine_service.thrift --method BillingEngineService/CreateLoan --endpoint 127.0.0.1:60001 -d '{"customer_id":"38999017589327100","principal":5000000,"term_weeks":60}'
```

5. CreateCustomer:

```bash
kitexcall --idl-path ./conf/.idl/billing_engine/billing_engine_service.thrift --method BillingEngineService/CreateCustomer --endpoint 127.0.0.1:60001 -d '{"name":"Jane Doe Doe","phone_number":"08182938471231"}'      
```

## HTTP Testing with **Postman**

1. Import the collection from `./billing-engine.postman_collection.json`.
2. Import environment variables file if available.
3. Configure `baseUrl`.
4. Run requests for `GetOutstanding`, `IsDelinquent`, `MakePayment`.

---

## Example Use Case

* Create loan for Rp 5,000,000 with 50 weeks schedule.
* Borrower makes weekly payments of Rp 110,000.
* If borrower misses 2 consecutive weeks → delinquent.
* Outstanding balance reduces with each payment until 0.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **Kitex GOPATH issue**: use `-module` flag or ensure `go.mod` exists.
* **DB errors**: ensure migrations applied.
* **NSQ EOF errors**: check nsqd address and config.
